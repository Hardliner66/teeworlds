### iFreeze+

As you see it also includes the iFreeze-gametype which was very popular in old 0.5.

The gameplay is similar to (open)FNG and TDM. You have just one weapon; your laser. If you kill a player he becomes frozen and cant move anymore. Your team will score when every tee of the opponent team is frozen, then all frozen players become melted and it starts again.

Of course you can also melt your teammates: When you stand near to a frozen teammate, after some time he becomes melted and can continue playing.
You will **score** both **by freezing** a opponent **and melting** a teammate. It is very important to melt your teammates, otherwise your team will probably loose.

## Rcon-Commands

_Note: The letters behind a command determines what kind of argument and how many are required. i = number, r = string. A leading questionmark (?) means the following argument is optional._
